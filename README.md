Run generative games on your own GPU.

Unlike traditional games, that run on a deterministic game engine, generative games use an interactive video model to generate every frame of the game in real-time, reacting to your button presses.

Currently, the models are dispersed across Github and hard to find. Even when you find one, it takes technical knowledge and time to run them yourself. So we're bringing them together for you to play.

Dweamworld is an open-source platform that makes it easy to play them locally, or stream from a server. 

## Features

- **Browse open-source game models**
     
     Collecting together all the available games made open-source by [Diamond](https://github.com/eloialonso/diamond) and other world creators!

- **Play Games**

    Jump into Yume Nikki, CS:GO, Atari Arcade Games or Mario Kart 64.

<br> </br>

- **Change Parameters**

   Adjust settings to allow higher FPS on lower-end GPUs (at the expense of game stability/quality).

## Requirements

- An NVIDIA GPU (ideally >8GB VRAM)
- OS: Windows (via exe, see [Windows Setup](#Windows)) or Linux (via Docker, see [Linux Setup](#Linux))

The Minecraft games are only supported on Linux; you can use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) on Windows to play them.

## Let's Play!

### Windows

1. Download dweam-windows.zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/dweam-team/dweamworld/releases).
2. Unzip the file using [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
3. Double-click dweam.exe, wait for the games to install, and start playing!

### Linux

#### Installing

Install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/),

Install [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

#### Running

```
git clone ssh://git@github.com/dweam-team/dweamworld
cd dweamworld
docker compose up --build
```

Once it's running, visit [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

#### Exposing to the internet/local network

By default, the backend and frontend will only bind to `localhost`.
Use a reverse proxy (like [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) or [nginx](https://nginx.org/)) to forward the following ports:
- 8080 TCP
- 4321 TCP

Expose the following ports for WebRTC:
- 3478 TCP/UDP
- 5349 TCP/UDP
- 50000-50010 UDP

## Adding a game

Each set of games is implemented as a standalone python package that:

1. Implements a `Game` class that subclasses `dweam.Game`.
2. Provides a `dweam.toml` file with the game's metadata.

See [diamond-yumenikki](https://github.com/dweam-team/diamond-yumenikki) or [diamond-csgo](https://github.com/dweam-team/diamond-csgo) for an example.

### Implement it

Subclass `dweam.Game`, and implement the `step` method.

```python
# my_game/dweam_game.py

from dweam import Game
import pygame


class MyGame(Game):
    def step(self) -> pygame.Surface:
        """
        A step of your game loop, that runs in its own thread.
        Use `self.keys_pressed`, `self.mouse_pressed` and `self.mouse_motion` to generate the next frame,
        and return it as a pygame surface.
        """
        ...

    def on_key_down(self, key: int) -> None:
        """
        Optionally, implement logic via key presses directly
        Other methods like `on_key_up`, `on_mouse_down`, `on_mouse_up` and `on_mouse_motion` are also available.
        """
        ...
```

### Add Metadata

Add a `dweam.toml` file with the game's metadata.

```toml
# my_game/dweam.toml

type = "Awesome Games"
entrypoint = "my_game.dweam_game:MyGame"
repo_link = "https://github.com/awesome-games/my-game"

[games.my_game]
title = "My Game"
tags = ["First Person"]
description = "A game made by me"

[games.my_game.buttons]
"‚¨ÜÔ∏è Forward" = "W"
"‚¨áÔ∏è Back" = "S"
"‚¨ÖÔ∏è Left" = "A"
"‚û°Ô∏è Right" = "D"
"üÜô Jump" = "Space"
```

### Share it

For now we're hardcoding the game packages in the [`entrypoint.py`](dweam/utils/entrypoint.py#L30) file ‚Äì please submit a pull request to add your game, in the form of a GitHub repo URL or python package.

Soon we'll make this a local configuration file ^w^"
